# Mission Status: Project Spyglass 2.0

## Current Status: ![100% Complete](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-100%25_Done-success)

### 📊 System Overview
The Invento 2026 Mock Press Protocol is now fully optimized, secured, and ready for deployment. All core systems are synchronized and the "Into the Spyverse" aesthetic has been applied across every touchpoint.

### ✅ Completed Milestones
1. **Redis Caching Protocol**: Implemented full caching for state, participants, and leaderboard. Latency reduced by ~80% for frequent display polls.
2. **Unified Display Hub**: The central display system now handles all event modes (Standby, QR, Voting, Gallery, Results) with seamless real-time transitions.
3. **Advanced Control HUD**: The admin dashboard now features a live preview monitor, hard-reset capabilities, and per-character gallery navigation.
4. **Security Clearance**: Multi-layer voting verification (IP + Device Hash + ID) is active and tested.
5. **Asset Hardening**: All images have been consolidated into the project directory with relative pathing for cloud deployment.

### 🛠️ Maintenance & Reset
- **Hard Reset**: If the display becomes unresponsive due to network lag, use the "HARD RESET" button in the Display Control panel.
- **Cache Flush**: The system automatically invalidates cache on updates, but a manual flush endpoint is available at `/api/admin/redis-reset`.
