*   **Anti-Fraud Tracking**: Triple-layer verification (IP, Device Hash, and Identify) to ensure 100% fair play.
*   **Live Average Score**: Real-time score aggregation shown on the main display upon result reveal.

### 🖥️ Display Control Center (The HUD)
*   **Director Mode**: Central hub for toggling Voting, Results, Gallery, or Standby modes.
